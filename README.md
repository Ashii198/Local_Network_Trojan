# Edit the IP address as server.py machines address on both files.
This is a fun project in which we can access a PC/Laptop's CMD and can execute instruction on victim's machine (Like, open Notepad,etc.) This is for fun you can't do extreme things with this script. 
There are two files game.py and server.py as we can take a guess by it's name for what they belongs to. In "game.py" file there is a game called guessing a number b/w (1-1000) just as simple as that......And the other part is trying to connect to the server by IP and PORT NUMBER on the localhost.

Run server.py as an attacker and after successfully executing enter "cmdon" to access cmd and "cmdoff" to terminate cmd access.

(NOTE: RUN THE SERVER.PY FILE BEFORE THE GAME.PY)
